# Advanced-Keylogger-System
 develop an advanced keylogger system that captures  keystrokes, takes screenshots, collects machine information, and sends this data to  a specified email address.
  The system is designed to run in the background without 
the user's knowledge or consent, making it difficult to detect or remove. The system 
uses various Python libraries, including socket, ‘smtplib’,’ PIL’, ‘win32clipboard’, 
‘pynput’, ‘sounddevice’, ‘time’, ‘scipy’, and ‘cryptography’, to perform its functions.
